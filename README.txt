SafeCrawler
Safer web-browsing through affective visualization.

Author: Oliver Schneider, April 2013

To install SafeCrawler, open up the Chrome Extensions page, enable
Developer Mode, and add the root folder (safecrawler) as an unpacked
extension. Once installed, you can use the popup menu to experiment
with the various visualizations.

SafeCrawler is designed to be extensible. Feel free to add new targets
in targets.js, or new visualizations in visualizations.js. Simply
add a new target or visualization as shown by the examples in the file,
and SafeCrawler will take care of the rest.

Safe crawling!
